A lightweight, high-performance library for tracking and publishing telemetry.

Developed by [Stas Sultanov][linked_in_profile], this library is designed for efficiency, prioritizing speed and minimal memory usage.

If this library benefits your business, consider [supporting the author](#support-the-author).

## Getting Started

For instructions on how to use the library, please read [this document](/src/readme.md).

## Why This Library?

Any qualified engineer will naturally ask: why use this library if Microsoft provides an official one?

There are several compelling reasons why the author chose to invest time and effort into creating this library:

- [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][app_insights_nuget_2_23] has flaws in its implementation.<br/>
  For instance, Entra authentication is implemented in a way that makes it impossible to use the library for plugin development.<br/>
  The issue is described by the author [here][app_insights_issue_auth], with little expectation that it will ever be fixed.
- [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][app_insights_nuget_2_23] has extra dependencies.<br/>
  For instance, [System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/) >= v5.0.0, which is deprecated and has subsequent dependencies.<br/>
  Extra dependencies add extra effort in resolving issues, especially in cases like plugin development.
- [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][app_insights_nuget_2_23] references NET452 and NET46 instead of NET462.<br/>
  Support for NET452 and NET46 ended on [April 26, 2022][dot_net_lifecycle].<br/>
  Support for NET462 ends on [January 12, 2027][dot_net_lifecycle].
- [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][app_insights_nuget_2_23] is considered for deprecation.<br/>
  As of the end of 2024, Microsoft recommends switching to [OpenTelemetry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview).
- The [OpenTelemetry][open_telemetry_nuget] library is not designed for plugin development.<br/>
  It heavily relies on static types and members that do not implement a thread-safe singleton pattern.
- Both [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][app_insights_nuget_2_23] and [OpenTelemetry][open_telemetry_nuget] are extremely heavy in some applications like NET462.<br/>
  This increases memory consumption and startup time.<br/>
  Take a look at the [comparison](#libraries-size-comparison) table.

### Libraries Size Comparison

A comparison of library sizes and file counts when used with Entra-based authentication:

| Package(s)                                   | NET462 | NET8 | NET9 |

## Quality

Ensuring high quality is a top priority. This project enforces multiple quality gates to maintain reliability and robustness:

1. The ruleset is configured with a target on the *main* branch and allows changes via pull request only.
2. The workflow [Check][workflow_check] is configured to run on pull requests to the *main* branch and does the following:
    - Checks that the code builds with no errors.
    - Runs unit tests with a coverage threshold of 95%.
    - Runs integration tests with a coverage threshold of 90%.<br/>
      During integration tests, the workflow creates an environment within Azure and disposes of it once the tests complete.
3. The [CodeQL][workflow_code_ql] workflow is configured to run on pull requests and commits to the *main* branch.
4. The project build is configured to:
    - Treat all warnings as errors.
    - Set the warning level to 9999.
    - Enforce code style in the build via [editorconfig](/.editorconfig).
    - Use dotNet analyzers with analysis level **latest-all**.
    - Generate a documentation file to ensure that all public members are documented.
