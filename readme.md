A lightweight, high-performance library for tracking and publishing telemetry.

Developed by [Stas Sultanov][linked_in_profile], this library is designed for efficiency, prioritizing speed and minimal memory usage.

If this library benefits your business, consider [supporting the author](#support-the-author).

## Getting Started

For instructions on how to use the library please read [this document](/src/readme.md).

## Why This Library?

Any qualified engineer will naturally ask: why use this library if Microsoft provides the official one?

Well, there are several compelling reasons why the author chose to invest life time and effort into creating this library:

- [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][app_insights_nuget_2_23] has flaws in implementation.<br/>
  For instance, Entra authentication is implemented the way it makes impossibility to use the library for Plugins development.
  The issue is described by the author [here][app_insights_issue_auth], with 0 expectation that it will be ever fixed.
- [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][app_insights_nuget_2_23] has extra references.<br/>
  To [System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/) v5.0.0 which is deprecated.
  The **System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource** package also has subsequent references.
  Extra references adds extra effort on resolving especially in cases like Plugins development.
- [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][app_insights_nuget_2_23] does not reference NET462 directly.
  NET462 support ends on [12 Jan 2027][dot_net_lifecycle].<br/>
  The Microsoft library references NET452 and NET46 which support ended on [26 Apr 2022][dot_net_lifecycle].
- [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][app_insights_nuget_2_23] considered for deprecation.<br/>
  As of end of year 2024 Microsoft recommends switching to Azure Monitor [open_telemetry_nuget](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/open_telemetry_nuget-enable) Distro.
- The [open_telemetry_nuget][open_telemetry_nuget] is not designed to be used for plugins development.<br/>
  The library heavily rely on use of static data which does not implement thread safe singleton pattern.
- Both [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights][app_insights_nuget_2_23] and [open_telemetry_nuget][open_telemetry_nuget] are extremely heavy in some applications like NET462.<br/>
  This increases memory consumption and time to start.<br/>
  Take a look at the [comparison](#libraries-size-comparison) table.

### Libraries Size Comparison

A comparison of library sizes and file counts when used with Entra-based authentication:

| Package(s)                                   | NET462 | NET8 | NET9 |

## Quality

Ensuring high quality is a top priority. This project enforces multiple quality gates to maintain reliability and robustness:

1. The [ruleset][github_rule_sets] is configured with target on the *main* branch, and allow changes via pull request only
2. The workflow [Check][workflow_check] configured to run on pull request to the *main* branch, and does the following:
    - check that code builds with no errors
    - run unit tests with coverage threshold of 95%
    - run integration tests with coverage thresholds of 90%<br/>During integration tests, the workflow creates an environment within Azure and disposes it once the tests complete
3. The [CodeQL][workflow_code_ql] configured to run on pull requests and commits to the *main* branch
4. The project build is configured to:
    - Treat all warnings as errors
    - Warning level is set to 9999
    - Enforce code style in build, via [editorconfig](/.editorconfig)
    - Use dotNet analyzers with analysis level **latest-all**
    - Generate documentation file
